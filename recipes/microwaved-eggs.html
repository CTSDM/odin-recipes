        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Perfect for everyday breakfast. You just need eggs, microwaved, and cooked rice. It can't get much simpler than this.</p>
            
        <p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> If not done correctly, this can explode, either inside the microwave or in front of your face.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs: 2</li>
            <li>Either already cooked rice from past days or uncooked rice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>With cooked rice</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the eggs.</li>
            <li>Put some cooked rice in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Crack the eggs and add it to the small bowl. Cover it with some more cooked rice.</li>
            <li>Place the bowl inside the microwave and start microwaving. The time really depends on your microwave parameters. Until you get the hang of it, I recommend 30 seconds, then 20, then 10, etc. Every time checking how is the egg.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
